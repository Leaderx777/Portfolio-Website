✅ Next step:

Save this text as `README.md` in your repo root. Then run:



```bash

git add README.md

git commit -m "Add polished README for portfolio"

git push origin main

```



This way, your repo homepage looks professional on GitHub and points recruiters straight to your live site + resume.



Do you want me to also create a \*\*README badge block\*\* (build, deploy, codecov, etc.) at the top like you had in `mlops-demo` so it looks even more professional?
